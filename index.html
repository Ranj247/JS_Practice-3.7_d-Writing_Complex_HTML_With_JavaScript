            Using template literals to write complex HTML with JavaScript.
        </h1>
        <p>
            It allows to create complex HTML structures in your JavaScript code which can then be inserted into the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's best to write the structure of the HTML as a string and just use JavaScript to keep appending to the
            HTML string until it's complete, then set the document or the body's innerHTML property to your long HTML
            string.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, you will need to revisit and become comfortable with the concept of template literals.
            Luckily this is a simple concept. The only difference between a template literal and a string is the use of
            backticks
            instead of single or double quotes. Anything that comes from JavaScript, such as variables, get injected
            into
            the string
            using the $ operator and a set of curly braces, like this:
        </p>
        let myVariable = 123;
        <br>
        let myLiteral = `The value of my variable is ${myVariable}.`
        <p>
            The above will render "The value of my variable is 123." when evaluated.
            You can use this concept to write complex HTML structures like tables, lists, divs filled with lots of
            images or anything else you can imagine,
            by combining the concept of a template literal with the concept of iteration, data structures and JavaScript
            variables.
            The way developers usually tackle this is to begin with an empty string and then append HTML to it step by
            step in a loop or using some other JavaScript logic.
